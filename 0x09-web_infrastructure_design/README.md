** SYSTEM ENGINEERING DEVOPS **

(OS - UBUNTU 22.05 LTS)

This project covers the varioud shell commands used in Linux termina. All commands and scripts are written using the bash (Bourne Again Shell) scripting. The repository contains four projects each of which covers an aspect of shell. The project directories are named in such a way the number attached to the name proceeds from basics to more qdvanced. For example 0x00-Shell_basics is where you should start from to follow the ptoject in chronological order.

** SUMMARY OF THE PROJECTS COVERED **
There are a total of four (4) projects covered in the repository:

1) 0x00-shell_basics

2) 0x01-shell_permissions

3) 0x02-shell_redirections

4) 0x03-shell_variables_expansions

1) 0x00Shell Basics: This essentially covers the fundamentals of interacting with the bash shell in Linux. The shell is basically a program by which a user can interact with the Operating System. The shell actually consists of two parts; the system shell and the interactive shell. The system shell is the shell that interpretes and executes our commands, the interactive shell is what we see once we start up a shell program, it provides us an interface by which we can communicatw with the system.

2) 0x01-shell_permissions: Shell permissions covers the various file and directory permissions in shell. The concept of users and other in relation to file permission assignment is also introduced since a unix OS is a multi-user OS.

3) 0x02-shell_redirections: This project covers the means with which commands can be redirected to give different results through piping as well as other means by which the output we receive received asides the default stdout.

4) 0x03-shell_variables_expansions: This commands covers how commands can be expanded and how command substitution occurs within shell. Arithmetic expansion is also handled within the project.

All scripts can be run within the bash shell without problems.

NOTE: Some scripts uses variables, to have the best of these scripts create a global variable with the same name as the one in the script then execute.
